ADM: Monitoring Synrc Apps
==========================

Features
--------

Monitor KVS, N2O, BPE and other Synrc Applications.

Run
---

To try ADM you need to clone a ADM repo from Github and build it.
We use a very small and powerful tool called `mad`:

    $ git clone git://github.com/synrc/adm && cd adm
    $ mad dep com pla sh

Now you can try it out: [http://localhost:8108](http://localhost:8108)
